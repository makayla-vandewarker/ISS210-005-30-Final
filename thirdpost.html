                        <p>In the battle of world hunger, charities are the main combating force against it and have been for a long time. These organizations help by collecting mass amounts of food and distributing them to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and homes across the globe. A popular way for charities to help out is to have centers located in cities where people can come and grab the food like a grocery store. This concept called food banking was developed by a man named Jon Van Angel in Phoenix, AZ in the 1960s. He established the nation's first food bank called St. Mary's Food Bank. In their first year alone, they distributed over 275,000 pounds of food to people in need in the surrounding area. Plenty of other food banks began to pop up around the country over the following years which started to really make a dent in the world hunger problem. More people were getting food than ever before thanks to this simple and efficient way to get food. By the year 1977, food banks were up and running in 18 different cities across the United States and we haven't looked back since. According to Food banks news, there are 372 food banks in America today!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Feeding America</h2>
                        <p>One of, if not the most popular charity in the US regarding food insecurity is Feeding America. Feeding America was founded in 1979. The person who founded this charity is none other than the man I mentioned in the previous paragraph, (a true pioneer in the food banking industry) Jon Van Angel. The company was originally founded under the name Second Harvest which was the name all the way up until 2008, when they switched the name to Feeding America. This company owns over 200 foodbanks just by themselves and is responsible for feeding countless hungry mouths around the country. Feeding America is the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization and has played a giant role in our country through several rough times, including the coronavirus most recently. Last year feeding americas was responsible for delivering 5.2 billion meals to hungry people across the nation, more than doubling the next biggest charity's outreach. Feeding America does more for food insecurity than any other charity or organization by a landslide, without them millions would go hungry.  Feeding America will continue to provide beneficial food for the hungry people of our country for centuries to come!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What Ways YOU Can Help!</h2>
                        <p>There are plenty of ways you can help out in the battle against food insecurity. In Today's world there are hundreds of charities and organizations you could donate to to make a difference. Charities like Feeding America or the World Food Programme. Giant corporations like these use your money to buy food and feed starving families around our country and the world. The proceeds you donate will be directly helping put food into the mouths of those who need it and you can feel glad knowing you helped. Other great charities include: Heifer International, Action Against Hunger, The Hunger Project, Rise Against Hunger, World Central Kitchen, Feeding America, Mercy Corps, and so many others. Donating to these charities isn't the only way you can lend a hand in this fight. There are plenty of food banks and soup kitchens in cities near you that would love your help. Finding places to volunteer is very easy and it is extremely rewarding work. There are always organizations trying to help this issue in every city so just start looking for them! A great resource to try and help locate these kitchens by you is the Homeless Shelter Directory. The fight against world hunger is ongoing and people can always use more help, so do your part!</p>
