                        <p>In the battle of world hunger, charities are the main combating force against it and have been for a long time. These organizations help by collecting mass amounts of food and distributing them to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and homes across the globe. A popular way for charities to help out is to have centers located in cities where people can come and grab the food like a grocery store. This concept called food banking was developed by a man named Jon Van Angel in Phoenix, AZ in the 1960s. He established the nation's first food bank called St. Mary's Food Bank. In their first year alone, they distributed over 275,000 pounds of food to people in need in the surrounding area. Plenty of other food banks began to pop up around the country over the following years which started to really make a dent in the world hunger problem. More people were getting food than ever before thanks to this simple and efficient way to get food. By the year 1977, food banks were up and running in 18 different cities across the United States and we haven't looked back since. According to Food banks news, there are 372 food banks in America today!</p>
                        <p>Everytime you want to create a new paragraph, use these paragraph containers. For concision, you should have no more than five paragraphs and a minimum of one.</p>
                        <p>Be sure every paragraph has a main claim or takes the reader somewhere new. Then unpack that claim. What is significant? What do you want your viewer to remember? What is at stake?</p>
                        <p>If you do not want another paragraph, then simply delete ones that are unecessary.</p>
                        <p>Please be sure each post has some closure. That is, the last paragraph should be memorable. If they remember nothing else from this page, what do you hope your viewer learned?</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Second heading</h2>
                        <p>You can include calls to action or organize your information with subheadings like so. Just be sure you adjust the title of these headings if you use them.</p>
                        <p>This means your headings should not say second heading.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">You may copy or replace this code if you want to quote someone. Four lines of quotation or more (on the page) should be in block quotes, which is why these containers are called block quotes. Not creative but effective.</blockquote>
                        <p>Remember to always unpack a block quote. You should leave the reader remembering your voice, not someone else's.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Third heading</h2>
                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a pdf or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/handstoheart.jpeg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is how you add captions under an image. Cite your image here. You may also say something about it, if you like.</span>
                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
