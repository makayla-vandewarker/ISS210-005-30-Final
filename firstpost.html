                        <p>In past decades, before the age of iPhones and the 21st century, the quality of the food we eat as a population was much healthier and full of nutrients. Food was often home grown and didn’t contain harsh pesticides we use to treat our crops today. Before food had GMOs and was modified to fit the appetite of Americans. In our world today, it seems as though many people chose quantity rather than quality.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Studies that have been done to observe the change in nutrients in our daily food.</h2>
                        <p> A study that was performed by The Cornucopia Institute, has evidence that the nutrient content of conventionally grown vegetables and fruits has declined over the past 50 years. The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, compared U.S. Department of Agriculture data from 1950 and 1999. After rigorous statistical analysis, the researchers found that, on average, all three minerals evaluated have declined; two of five vitamins have declined; and protein content has dropped by 6 percent.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Obtaining Unhealthy Food is so Easy.</h2>
                        <p>While environment pollution and food additives such as GMOs have made our food unhealthier, it’s also much easier to obtain this unhealthy food. One major problem in our society today being, fast food. In just about any town you visit in the United States today, you will see a McDonalds, or Wendy’s or maybe even a Burger King. The problem with this is that it provides much cheaper and convenient food options for the citizens of today. 100 years ago, you couldn’t just take the family down the street and get dollar cheeseburgers for the whole family. Families actually had to grow, prepare, and cook the meals they would eat every day, and they knew, most likely, exactly where that food was coming from.</p>
