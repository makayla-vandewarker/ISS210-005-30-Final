                        <p>It's crucial to comprehend what food insecurity is before delving into how it now affects the world. Food insecurity is described as the inability of all members of a home to consistently have access to enough food for an active, and healthy lifestyle. The entire world's population is growing more worried about the future as a result of new wars and escalating tensions developing in third-world nations with significant food industries.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Affects of the Russia-Ukraine War</h2>
                        <p>The Ukraine's war with Russia prevents the export of wheat, grain, and maize. Food supplies in Ukraine are constrained as a result of Russia attacking multiple grain silos. Russia has also stopped all exports and imports to Ukraine. Consequently, there are minimal resources available to support Ukraine's war efforts. Every year, Ukraine exported two thirds of its grain, but due to recent events, no grain is being exported. The cost of breakfast items including cereal, bread, and oats has increased as a result of this conflict.   </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"Russia's invasion of Ukraine has provoked massive hikes in food prices and risk of food shortages. We need to act now and the way we address global food insecurity will be decisive for Europe's geopolitical standing" -Josep Borrell</blockquote>
                        <p>Most cilivans think that food prices have gone up because of the war. There are tensions not only between nations but also between people. instead of joining together, they opted to support their government. 
Everyone is the enemy. Families worry about being able to buy food at high prices, which has contributed to an increase in stress levels worldwide. Civilians desire both international peace and a plentiful food supply.  </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Affects of COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
                        <p>The world has been negatively impacted by COVID-19. It did, however, deplete the food supply, causing food shortages and, in certain places, like Africa, famine. Today, Africa is still experiencing food shortages and shelves in stores 
Each blog post should include image and a PDF or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image and a PDF. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
